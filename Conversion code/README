convert.sql: converstion code using MS SQL
convert.py: updated code on Jan 5th, 2020 to generate mysql (or sqlite3) files
  - steps to see if the sql file were properly created from the json:
        1. > sqlite3 data.db
        2. sqlite> .table
        3. sqlite> .schema
              - will show the contents of the file (the CREATE statements)
